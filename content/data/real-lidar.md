Our real LIDAR point cloud dataset is based on the KITTI dataset, 00 frame. It's 
the standard one for LiDAR odometry/SLAM evaluation and contains statistics on a vast slice of SOTA methods.

Additionally, it was extended with semantic labels in the SemanticKITTI.

Statistics on segmented planes from EVOPS: 
- number of annotated observation --- 4541;
- total planes --- 1184.
